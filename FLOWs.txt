PRECONDITIONS:
- astroviewer-adapter add an event listener for CustomEvent("cameraChanged") init()
- astro-controller registers itself by calling astroviewer-adapter.onStateChanged 
and passing as callback cb the emit of 'astro.state.changed'

FLOW:
1. AstroViewer: issues CustomEvent("cameraChanged") -> 
astroviewer-adapter event listener catches the event -> 
astroviewer-adapter notifyIfChanged calls all callbacks registered (via listeners) ->
astro-controller registered callback is called and:
    bus.emit('astro.state.changed', { state })
-> all components listening on bus.on('astro.state.changed') are triggered
